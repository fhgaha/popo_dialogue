1. Every time a dialog is created there is a recourse created in the same folder with `_graph.res` in 
the end of file name. For example: we create a dialogue named `MyDialogue`, we will see a folder
created at `res://game/dialogs/my_dialogue/`. Inside that folder there are files

		   my_dialogue.gd
		   my_dialogue.tres
		   my_dialogue_graph.res

The file `my_dialogue_graph.res` is the graph file. It is empty after dialogue creation.

2. To open a graph double-click on a graph file. A window will popup. You can create nodes using RMB,
and connect those nodes. To delete a node select it and press delete key.

3. To save the graph click save button inside the graph window.
